WindowsSetup.bat will call WindowsSetup.ps1
both sh file and ps1 file will ask forthe credentials for the DB, and build the Credentials schema accordingly,
after that it will ask what container service you want to start and ask for DB credentials and other DB information,
it will then start the container using the local dockerfile configuraion and keep going for the next container

each container will check on its own using the Credentials.ini or Credentials.json file, what is the DB and how to connect to it,
and will perform a check that all schemas exist, and build whatever missing on the DB

After that it will start running indefinetly and adding information to the DB.
