WindowsSetup.bat will call WindowsSetup.ps1
both sh file and ps1 file will ask forthe credentials for the DB, and build the Credentials schema accordingly,
after that it will ask what container service you want to start and ask for DB credentials and other DB information,
it will then start the container using the local dockerfile configuraion and keep going for the next container

each container will check on its own using the Credentials.ini or Credentials.json file, what is the DB and how to connect to it,
and will perform a check that all schemas exist, and build whatever missing on the DB

After that it will start running indefinetly and adding information to the DB.

WindowsSetup.bat -> Explained about BE - Database Connector, ask and request creds for the main databse for the DomRec-Credentials table,continuesly asks creds for every database that we should save output(json) to -> creates a list of databases in defined order to get credentials from if one crashes -> Tests connection to database, creates the DomRec-Credentials Table -> from now on there is a list of databases to take credentials is the current ones does not work, the services should automatically request their new credentials.
Asks what BE Services should run, turn them on and listen for incoming json data, dynamicly create tablesm rows and columns in the databases according to recieved data
